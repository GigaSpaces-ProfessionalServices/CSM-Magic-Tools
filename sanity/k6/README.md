# k6pexec.sh
Parameterized, file based serialized/perallel execution of K6 testing

## Components
* k6pexec.sh - Main script.
* template.js - The k6 template file from which the scripts run by k6 are created.
* service_example - A list of services
* ids.txt - A list of IDs

## Runtime
k6pexec.sh creates two folders during runtime: scripts and output.
In scripts k6pexec.sh creates the *.js files accordding to the parameters (IDs and service name) using the template.js to create a specific file per ID.

All results are written in the output folder for post-run reports. old reports are kept by default unless k6pexec.sh is run using the `-d` switch.

## Usage
The JS script run by k6 is autogenerated in runtime. It requires a list of IDs and a service file with service parameters.
* IDs file: a simple line-by-line list of IDs. file supplied as parameter to k6pexec.sh.
* Service file: see service_example for reference. file supplied as parameter to k6pexec.sh.

```
k6pexec.sh -h
```
